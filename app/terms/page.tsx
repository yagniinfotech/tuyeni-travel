                We <strong>strongly recommend</strong> that you obtain
                comprehensive travel insurance prior to your departure. This

                cancellation, medical emergencies, evacuation from remote areas,
                or lost luggage. Tuyeni Travel is not liable for costs incurred

                date), necessary visas, and any required health documentation or
                vaccinations for your travel to Namibia. We are not liable for
